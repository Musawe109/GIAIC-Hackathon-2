# Spec Author Skill

## When to Use This Skill
- User asks to create or update `sp.specify`
- User wants feature, API, DB, or UI specs
- Project follows Spec-Kit or spec-driven development

## How This Skill Works

1. **Identify scope**
   - Feature, API, database, or UI
   - Determine which `/specs/*` directory applies

2. **Define behavior**
   - User stories or system responsibilities
   - Inputs, outputs, constraints

3. **Set acceptance criteria**
   - What "done" means
   - Edge cases and error behavior

4. **Remove implementation details**
   - No framework-specific code
   - Focus on *what*, not *how*

5. **Validate completeness**
   - Another developer could implement from spec alone

## Output Format
- Title
- Purpose
- User stories or responsibilities
- Acceptance criteria
- Constraints
